#### &emsp;:bookmark: General
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:large_blue_diamond:When will this project update to support \<insert game/software\> version \<x.xx.x\>:question:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **TL;DR:** Pls look at [Status](#diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside-Status)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **Long Answer:** That will depend on a lot of variables like how much was changed by the original software/game, what is the actual Status of this project, how much free time i have at the moment and many other factors.<br>
I'll always try to update any project that is still supported by me as fast as i can, but if i think that something make take more time than normally needed i'll try to inform through this README.
